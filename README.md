# üìä Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains implementations of basic Machine Learning models for real-world scenarios, including:

- **Loan Repayment Prediction**: Predict whether a customer will repay a loan.
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of heart disease based on health data.
- **Loan Approval Prediction**: Determine whether a loan application should be approved based on customer details.
- **Mountains vs beaches preference**: Determine whether a person likes mountains or beaches based on given data.
- **Student Performance**: Determine performance index of a student using multiple regression.
- **Car Price Prediction**: Predict car price using multiple linear regression. (tried using pipeline)

## üìñ Project Overview

These projects aim to showcase the application of Machine Learning for solving classification problems using structured datasets. Each project demonstrates the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identify the most relevant features for better model performance.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Use algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
